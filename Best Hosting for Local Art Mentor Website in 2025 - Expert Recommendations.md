### Website Builder:

Bluehost guarantees a strong uptime, ensuring your website remains accessible to visitors. Although they don't publicize a specific uptime percentage, they are known for reliable performance. For faster loading times, especially important for showcasing high-resolution art images, consider opting for a plan that utilizes solid-state drives (SSDs) and caching technologies.

### Pricing:
Bluehost's basic plans are very affordable, making it a great option for budget-conscious art mentors. Their promotional pricing is attractive for the initial term but be aware that renewal prices are higher. Consider the long-term costs when selecting a plan.
