Moving your existing website to Scala Hosting is made easy with their free website migration service. Their team of experts will handle the entire migration process, ensuring a seamless transfer of your website files, databases, and emails without any downtime. This is a valuable service for businesses that want to switch hosting providers without the hassle.

### Security Features:
Security is a top priority for Scala Hosting. They offer free SSL certificates, daily backups, and advanced security measures to protect your website from threats. Their servers are equipped with firewalls and intrusion detection systems to prevent unauthorized access. They also provide proactive monitoring to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.

### Pricing:
